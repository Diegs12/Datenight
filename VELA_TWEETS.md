# Vela Launch Tweets — 4 Weeks + Launch Day

---

## Week 1: Plant the Seed

**Monday**
> I've been sitting on an idea for a while now.
>
> Most guys I know want to plan good dates for their girlfriend. They just don't know how.
>
> So they Google "date ideas" and end up at the same restaurant they've been to four times.
>
> I think I can fix this.

---

**Tuesday**
> The bar for planning a date is so low and guys still trip over it.
>
> Not because they don't care. Because nobody teaches you how to plan a date that actually fits the person you're with.
>
> We just wing it and hope for the best.

---

**Wednesday**
> Started building an app. It's a date night planner.
>
> You answer a few questions about your partner and it tells you what kind of dates she'd actually enjoy.
>
> Not a generic list from some blog. Dates scored to her personality.
>
> We'll see where it goes.

---

**Thursday**
> Funny thing about planning dates.
>
> You can know someone for years and still not know what kind of date they'd love.
>
> You know their coffee order. You know their favorite show. But you couldn't tell me if they'd rather do a pottery class or a rooftop bar.
>
> That gap is what I'm building for.

---

**Friday**
> I think the reason most guys default to dinner is because it's safe.
>
> You're not going to mess up dinner. Nobody's mad about dinner.
>
> But nobody's bragging about dinner either.

---

**Saturday**
> Quick thought on this.
>
> Women end up planning most of the dates. Not because they want to. Because their boyfriend ran out of ideas after month three.
>
> This isn't a character flaw. It's a tools problem.

---

**Sunday**
> Building something I wish existed two years ago.
>
> A date night app that actually knows what your partner likes.
>
> More soon.

---

## Week 2: Show What You're Building

**Monday**
> The app has a quiz. 13 questions about your partner.
>
> Energy level. What vibes she's into. Food preferences. Budget. All of it.
>
> Then it scores every date idea in the library against her answers.
>
> You stop guessing. The math tells you what she'd love.

---

**Tuesday**
> 90 date ideas across 8 categories.
>
> Chill. Food. Creative. Outdoor. Adventure. Nightlife. Romantic. Meaningful.
>
> Every single one gets a compatibility score based on who your partner actually is.
>
> Not who you think she is. Who she actually is.

---

**Wednesday**
> The part that took the longest to build was the scoring.
>
> It's not just "she likes food so here's a food date."
>
> It factors in energy level, budget, physical activity comfort, alcohol preferences, cuisine favorites, vibe.
>
> If she's a homebody who loves Italian food and hates hiking, it knows.

---

**Thursday**
> Showed it to a friend yesterday.
>
> He took the quiz, got his recommendations, and said "how does this know her better than I do?"
>
> That's the whole point.

---

**Friday**
> One of my favorite features.
>
> You can send your partner a mystery invite. She gets a teaser and a calendar hold but no details.
>
> She shows up not knowing what you planned.
>
> That's how you build anticipation.

---

**Saturday**
> Don't let the words on the page get in the way of what you're trying to say.
>
> I wrote that about college writing but it applies to dates too.
>
> Don't overthink it. Just know what she likes and plan around that.
>
> That's all this app does.

---

**Sunday**
> The app is called Vela.
>
> Launching in two weeks.

---

## Week 3: Build Anticipation

**Monday**
> Vela in 30 seconds.
>
> Take a quiz about your partner. Get date ideas scored to her preferences. Plan the one she'd love most.
>
> No more "what do you want to do tonight."
>
> Launching in 2 weeks.

---

**Tuesday**
> I built this because I was the guy who spent 45 minutes Googling date ideas and still ended up at the same place.
>
> She never said anything about it. But I could tell.
>
> That's a worse feeling than just asking her what she wants to do.

---

**Wednesday**
> Showed Vela to five people this week.
>
> Every one of them said some version of "why doesn't this already exist."
>
> I don't know. But it does now.

---

**Thursday**
> Honest thought.
>
> Most date night advice online is written by people who haven't planned a date in years.
>
> "Try a cooking class!" Cool. She hates cooking.
>
> Personalization isn't a feature. It's the whole point.

---

**Friday**
> Before Vela you're Googling "date ideas" at 4pm and picking the first thing that doesn't sound terrible.
>
> After Vela you open the app and it already knows what she'd love.
>
> That's it. That's the difference.

---

**Saturday**
> Sometimes it's just not that deep.
>
> Planning a good date doesn't require a grand gesture. It requires knowing what she actually enjoys.
>
> Vela figures that out in two minutes. You get the credit.

---

**Sunday**
> One week out.
>
> Vela launches next Monday. I'll drop the link here.

---

## Week 4: Countdown

**Monday**
> 7 days.
>
> I've been building this thing in my apartment for months. Next Monday it goes live and everyone gets to decide if it's any good.
>
> Terrified. But ready.

---

**Tuesday**
> Real talk.
>
> I have no team. No funding. Just me and an idea that wouldn't leave me alone.
>
> I built every screen, wrote every date idea, coded every feature.
>
> If it works, cool. If it doesn't, at least I'll know I tried.

---

**Wednesday**
> 5 days out.
>
> The thing nobody tells you about building something alone is that you have no one to tell you if it's good.
>
> You just keep building and trust that the problem is real enough that the solution matters.

---

**Thursday**
> You will never have anything creative to say if you never let yourself say anything.
>
> Same applies to dates. You'll never plan a great one if you never try something different.
>
> Vela makes the "trying something different" part easy.
>
> 4 days.

---

**Friday**
> I keep going back and forth between "this is going to be great" and "nobody is going to care."
>
> Probably somewhere in the middle. That's fine.
>
> Monday.

---

**Saturday**
> Tomorrow I'm going to take a breath.
>
> Monday I'm going to launch Vela and let it speak for itself.
>
> If you know a guy who's bad at planning dates, send him my way Monday. I built this for him.

---

**Sunday**
> Tomorrow.
>
> Vela goes live tomorrow morning. I'll drop the link at 9.

**11:00 AM — The Story Thread**

> **1/** I just launched Vela. Here's why I built it.

> **2/** Every guy I know has the same problem. They want to plan good dates but they don't know where to start. So they default to dinner. Again. And their partner ends up planning everything. And nobody's happy about it.

> **3/** I was this guy. I'd spend more time stressing about what to do than actually enjoying the date. And I'd still end up somewhere she'd already been.

> **4/** So I started paying attention. What kind of dates does she actually like? What's her energy level? What vibes is she into? What's the budget? I started keeping track.

> **5/** That system became Vela. You take a quiz about your partner. The app scores 90+ date ideas against her answers. You pick the best one and plan it. No Googling. No guessing.

> **6/** I built the whole thing myself. Every screen. Every date idea. The scoring engine. Everything. No team. No investors. Just months of work in my apartment.

> **7/** It's live now. If you've ever panicked about what to plan for date night, this is for you. Link in my bio. And if you know a guy who needs this, send him this thread.
