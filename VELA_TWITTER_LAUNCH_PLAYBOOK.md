## 1. Pre-Launch Strategy (Weeks 4-1 Before Launch)

The goal of the pre-launch phase is to build an audience that already cares about Vela before launch day. Research shows that launching to an existing audience is the single biggest predictor of a successful indie app launch. Marc Lou grew from 1K to 45K+ followers on Twitter before launching ShipFast, and a single announcement tweet reached 167,000 impressions.

### Week 4: Establish the Narrative

**Objective:** Introduce yourself, the problem, and signal that something is coming.

**Tweet 1 -- The Origin Story (Thread)**
```
I've been thinking about this for months.

Every guy I know has the same problem:

They want to plan great dates for their partner. But they have no idea where to start.

Google "date ideas" and you get the same generic list every time.

So I'm building something. More soon.
```

**Tweet 2 -- The Relatable Problem**
```
Planning a date shouldn't feel like a homework assignment.

But for most guys, it does.

"Where should we go?"
"What should we do?"
"Will she even like this?"

Working on something to fix this.
```

**Tweet 3 -- Build-in-Public Signal**
```
Day 1 of building a date night app as a solo founder.

Here's what I know:
- Guys want to plan better dates
- They don't know where to start
- Generic lists don't work
- Personalization is everything

Here's what I don't know yet:
- If anyone will care

Let's find out.
```

### Week 3: Show the Work (Build in Public)

**Objective:** Share behind-the-scenes progress. Screenshots, design decisions, feature previews.

**Tweet 4 -- Behind the Scenes**
```
Building the quiz that powers Vela.

The idea: you answer questions about your partner's preferences, and we recommend dates they'll actually love.

Not "dinner and a movie."

Dates that feel like you put thought into them. Because you did.

[screenshot of quiz UI]
```

**Tweet 5 -- The Numbers**
```
90+ date ideas.
8 categories.
1 quiz about your partner.

Personalized date recommendations that actually match what she likes.

This is Vela. Launching soon.

[screenshot or mockup]
```

**Tweet 6 -- Interactive Poll**
```
Quick poll for the guys:

What's the hardest part about planning a date?

- Coming up with the idea
- Knowing if she'll like it
- Planning the logistics
- All of the above
```

### Week 2: Build Anticipation

**Objective:** Create urgency and desire. Start revealing the product name, visuals, and details.

**Tweet 7 -- Name Reveal / Teaser**
```
The app is called Vela.

It means "sail" -- as in, set sail on a date worth remembering.

Take a 2-minute quiz about your partner.
Get personalized date recommendations scored to her preferences.
Plan the whole thing in the app.

Launching [date]. Stay tuned.

[brand visual / logo]
```

**Tweet 8 -- Countdown Start**
```
10 days until Vela launches.

Here's what it does in 30 seconds:

1. Take a quiz about your partner's likes
2. Get scored date recommendations from 90+ ideas
3. Pick one and plan it

No more "idk, what do you want to do?"

[short demo video or GIF]
```

**Tweet 9 -- Social Proof / Validation**
```
Showed Vela to 5 friends this week.

Every single one said the same thing:

"Dude, I needed this 3 years ago."

If you've ever panicked the day before a date with no plan, this is for you.

Launching [date].
```

### Week 1: Final Push

**Objective:** Daily countdown. Amplify urgency. Engage with replies. Ask for retweets.

**Tweet 10 -- 5-Day Countdown**
```
5 days.

Vela launches in 5 days.

A date night app that actually knows what your partner likes.

RT if you know a guy who needs this.
```

**Tweet 11 -- The Personal Story**
```
Real talk: I built Vela because I was that guy.

I'd spend 45 minutes scrolling through "top date ideas in [city]" articles, only to end up at the same restaurant again.

My partner deserved better. So I built something better.

Launching this week.
```

**Tweet 12 -- Day Before Launch**
```
Tomorrow.

Vela goes live tomorrow.

90+ date ideas. Personalized to her. Planned by you.

Set your alarm. I'll drop the link at [time].
```

---

## 2. Launch Day Strategy

Research shows most successful launches happen Tuesday through Thursday, between 9 AM and 12 PM in your target audience's timezone. Plan for multiple tweets throughout the day, not just one.

### The Launch Tweet (Primary -- Post at 9-10 AM)

**Structure:** Hook + Problem + Solution + Social Proof/Specificity + Clear CTA

```
I just launched Vela.

A date night planning app for guys who actually want to impress their partner.

Here's how it works:
- Take a 2-min quiz about your partner
- Get personalized date recommendations from 90+ ideas
- Every date is scored to match her preferences
- Plan the whole date in the app

I built this as a solo founder because I was tired of Googling "date ideas near me" and getting the same 10 suggestions.

Your partner deserves better than "Netflix and chill."

Try it free: [link]

RT to help a guy who needs this.
```

### Launch Day Thread (Post 1-2 hours after launch tweet)

```
Tweet 1/7:
I spent [X months] building Vela as a solo founder.

Today it's live.

Here's the full story of why I built a date night planning app -- and what I learned along the way.

🧵

Tweet 2/7:
The problem is simple:

Most guys want to plan great dates. But they don't know how.

They Google "date ideas" and get generic listicles. Or they default to dinner and a movie. Again.

Their partner ends up planning everything. And nobody's happy.

Tweet 3/7:
I was this guy.

I'd spend more time picking a restaurant than actually enjoying the date. And I'd still pick wrong.

So I started keeping a spreadsheet of date ideas sorted by what my partner liked.

That spreadsheet became Vela.

Tweet 4/7:
Here's how Vela works:

1. You take a quick quiz about your partner's preferences
2. Vela scores 90+ date ideas across 8 categories
3. You pick the highest-scored dates
4. The app helps you plan it

It's like having a personal date consultant in your pocket.

Tweet 5/7:
The 8 categories:

[List your 8 categories here]

Each date idea is scored based on your partner's quiz results. So you're not guessing anymore.

Tweet 6/7:
I built this entire app solo.

Design. Code. Content. Everything.

If you're a solo founder, you know the feeling -- it's terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.

Tweet 7/7:
Vela is live now.

If you've ever panicked about planning a date, this is for you.

Try it: [link]

And if you know a guy who needs this, send him this thread.
```

### Launch Day Supporting Tweets

**Mid-Day Update (2-3 PM)**
```
Vela has been live for [X] hours.

[X] people have already taken the quiz.

```

**Evening Reflection (7-8 PM)**
```
Launch day is almost over.

Some takeaways:
- [Real-time observation]
- [Surprising stat]
- [User reaction]

Thank you to everyone who tried Vela today. This is just the beginning.
```

## 3. Post-Launch Strategy (Weeks 1-8 After Launch)

Research shows 65% of products lose momentum within 90 days of launch. The post-launch phase is about maintaining visibility and building a content engine that keeps driving downloads.

### Week 1 Post-Launch: Capitalize on Momentum

**User Reactions & Social Proof**
```
"My girlfriend asked me how I came up with this date idea. I just smiled."

This is the kind of DM that makes building Vela worth it.

[screenshot of DM/review, with permission]
```

**Milestone Updates**
```
72 hours since launch.

[X] quizzes taken.
[X] dates planned.
[X] "why didn't this exist before" messages.

We're just getting started.
```

**Lesson Learned Thread**
```
I launched Vela 5 days ago.

Here's everything I learned from launching a consumer app as a solo founder:

🧵

[Share honest metrics, surprises, what worked, what didn't]
```

### Weeks 2-4: Content Engine

Shift from launch-mode to value-mode. The 80/20 rule applies: 80% valuable/entertaining content, 20% promotional.

**Recurring Content Series Ideas:**

1. **"Date of the Week"** -- Feature one date idea from the app each week with tips
```
Date of the Week: Sunset Picnic

What you need:
- A blanket
- Cheese, crackers, wine
- A spot with a view
- Zero phone usage

Vela score for partners who love: outdoors, food, quality time = 94/100

[link]
```

2. **"Dating Data"** -- Share anonymized trends from the app
```
Vela data this week:

- Most popular category: [X]
- Least picked date idea: [X]
- Average quiz time: [X] minutes
- Most common partner preference: [X]

Guys are learning what their partners actually want. And it's not what they expected.
```

3. **"Guys vs. What She Actually Wants"** -- Relatable humor
```
What guys think she wants:
- Expensive restaurant
- Flowers
- Grand gestures

What she actually wants (according to Vela quizzes):
- Effort
- Thoughtfulness
- Something different

The bar is on the floor. And Vela helps you clear it.
```

4. **"Solo Founder Diaries"** -- Build in public continues
```
Week 3 of running Vela:

Things going well:
- [metric]
- [user feedback]

Things I'm working on:
- [feature]
- [bug fix]

Things keeping me up at night:
- [honest challenge]

Building alone is hard. But the DMs from guys saying "she loved the date" make it worth it.
```

### Weeks 5-8: Expand and Experiment

**Seasonal/Event Content**
```
Valentine's Day is [X] days away.

If your plan is "nice restaurant + roses," you're doing what every other guy is doing.

Vela has 12 Valentine's date ideas scored to what YOUR partner actually likes.

Stand out: [link]

**Feature Announcements**
```
New in Vela:

## 4. Content Categories That Perform Well

Based on research into viral indie app launches and dating content, here are the content buckets ranked by effectiveness for Vela:

### Tier 1: Highest Engagement Potential

**1. Relatable Dating Humor**
Dating/relationship content is among the most viral content categories on Twitter. The universal frustrations of date planning ("what do you want to eat?" standoffs, the pressure of planning, googling "date ideas" desperately) are comedy gold and highly shareable.

Example:
```
Him: "I planned something special tonight"
Her: *excited*
Him: "We're going to that restaurant we've been to 47 times"
Her: ...

Download Vela. Break the cycle.
```

**2. Problem/Solution Framing**
The PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) framework is consistently one of the highest-performing tweet formats. Vela's problem space is extremely relatable.

Example:
```
The problem: Planning dates is stressful.
The reality: You end up doing the same 3 things on rotation.
The solution: An app that knows what she likes better than you do.

That's Vela.
```

**3. Build in Public / Founder Journey**
Solo founder stories generate 54% more engagement when presented as threads vs. single tweets. Transparency about metrics, struggles, and wins builds trust and community.

### Tier 2: Strong Engagement

**4. Data and Insights**
Sharing anonymized data from the app (most popular categories, quiz trends, surprising findings) positions Vela as an authority and generates curiosity.

**5. Behind-the-Scenes**
Screenshots of the design process, code, user feedback, and decision-making. Especially powerful when combined with storytelling.

**6. Actionable Date Tips**
Practical value that stands alone even without downloading the app. This builds goodwill and positions the account as a follow-worthy resource.

### Tier 3: Supporting Content

**7. Polls and Interactive Content**
Twitter polls drive 7x higher engagement on video content and signal to the algorithm that a post is engaging, increasing reach.

**8. User Testimonials / Success Stories**
Social proof from real users. Most effective when the story is specific and emotional ("she said it was the best date we've ever had").

**9. Seasonal/Trending Content**
Tie into Valentine's Day, anniversaries, holidays, seasonal activities. Time-sensitive content creates urgency.

---

## 5. Tweet Formats That Drive Engagement

### Format 1: The Thread (Highest Reach)
Threads generate 54% more engagement than single tweets. Optimal length is 8-12 tweets. Include at least one image per 3-4 tweets for 40% higher completion rates.

**Best for:** Origin stories, launch announcements, lessons learned, how-it-works explanations.

### Format 2: The Bold Hook + List
```
[Bold claim or contrarian take]

Here's why:

1. [Point]
2. [Point]
3. [Point]
4. [Point]
5. [Point]

[CTA]
```

**Best for:** Problem framing, feature highlights, dating advice.

### Format 3: The "You Don't Need X, You Need Y"
```
You don't need [popular thing].
You need [better alternative].

[Explanation]
```

Example:
```
You don't need more date night ideas.
You need the RIGHT date night ideas.

Ones that match what your partner actually enjoys, not what some blog says is "romantic."

That's why I built Vela.
```

### Format 4: The Before/After
```
Before Vela:
- Googling "date ideas" at 4pm
- Picking the same restaurant again
- "I don't know, what do YOU want to do?"

After Vela:
- Personalized recommendations in 2 minutes
- 90+ ideas you'd never think of
- Actually impressing your partner

[link]
```

### Format 5: The Poll
```
[Question that reveals a relatable pain point]

- Option A
- Option B
- Option C
- Option D (the funny/honest one)
```

Example:
```
How do you usually plan a date?

- Google "date ideas near me"
- Ask her what she wants to do
- Repeat what worked last time
- Panic and order takeout
```

### Format 6: The Personal Story
```
[Vulnerable opener about a real experience]

[2-3 sentences of context]

[What you learned / what you built because of it]

[CTA]
```

### Format 7: The Meme / Screenshot
Visual content gets 150% more retweets. Create relatable dating memes, screenshot funny moments, or share "texts between couples" style content that naturally ties back to Vela.

### Format 8: The Specific Number
```
I spent [specific timeframe] building [thing].

[Specific result or metric].

Here's the breakdown:

[Details]
```

Example:
```
I spent 6 months building a database of 90+ date ideas across 8 categories.

Then I built a quiz that scores every idea against your partner's actual preferences.

The result: guys are planning dates their partners genuinely love.

That's Vela. Try it free: [link]
```

## 6. Specific Tweet Templates for Vela

Here are 20+ ready-to-adapt tweet templates tailored to Vela:

### Pre-Launch Templates

**Template 1: The Question Hook**
```
Why is planning a date still this hard in 2026?

We have AI that writes essays, apps that plan our meals, and algorithms that pick our music.

But when it comes to planning a date? You're on your own.

Not anymore. Building something. More soon.
```

**Template 2: The Observation**
```
I noticed something:

Women plan most of the dates in relationships. Not because they want to, but because guys don't know where to start.

This isn't a character flaw. It's a tools problem.

And I'm solving it.
```

**Template 3: The Stat Hook**
```
I talked to 30 couples.

27 of them said the same person plans every date.

It's not that the other person doesn't care. They just don't know how to plan something she'll love.

Building an app to fix that. It's called Vela.
```

### Launch Day Templates

**Template 4: The Clean Launch**
```
Vela is live.

Take a 2-min quiz about your partner.
Get date ideas scored to her preferences.
Plan a date she'll actually love.

90+ ideas. 8 categories. 1 app.

[link]
```

**Template 5: The Emotional Launch**
```
I built Vela for every guy who's ever said "I don't know, what do you want to do?"

It's a date night app that actually knows what your partner wants.

Take the quiz. Trust the scores. Plan the date.

She'll think you're a genius. I won't tell.

[link]
```

**Template 6: The Solo Founder Launch**
```
6 months ago I started building an app in my apartment.

Today it's live.

Vela: a date night planning app that personalizes everything to your partner.

No team. No funding. Just one guy who was tired of bad dates.

[link]
```

### Post-Launch Templates

**Template 7: The Relatable Humor**
```
Therapists: "You need to put more effort into the relationship."

Guys: *downloads Vela*

Therapists: "...I meant emotionally but honestly this works too."
```

**Template 8: The Data Share**
```
Interesting Vela data this week:

73% of guys underestimate how much their partner values outdoor activities.

The quiz changes everything.
```

**Template 9: The Testimonial**
```
Got this DM today:

"Planned a stargazing picnic from Vela. She cried. Good tears."

This is why I built this app.
```

**Template 10: The Quick Tip**
```
Date planning tip most guys miss:

It's not about how much you spend.

It's about how well you know what she likes.

(Vela figures that out in 2 minutes.)
```

**Template 11: The Hot Take**
```
Unpopular opinion:

"Dinner and a movie" isn't a date. It's a default.

Real dates require knowing what your partner actually enjoys.

That's what Vela is for.
```

**Template 12: The Seasonal**
```
It's [season].

Here are 5 [season] date ideas from Vela that aren't "go to a pumpkin patch":

1. [Idea]
2. [Idea]
3. [Idea]
4. [Idea]
5. [Idea]

Get personalized recommendations: [link]
```

**Template 13: The "Imagine" Format**
```
Imagine opening an app, spending 2 minutes on a quiz, and getting a list of dates your partner will genuinely love.

No Googling. No guessing. No defaulting to the same place.

That's Vela.
```

**Template 14: The Challenge**
```
Challenge: Plan a date this week that ISN'T something you've done before.

Need help? Vela has 90+ ideas scored to what your partner actually likes.

Reply with what you planned. Best one gets [prize/shoutout].
```

**Template 15: The Comparison**
```
Planning a date without Vela:
1. Google "date ideas"
2. Scroll past 40 sponsored results
3. Find a generic list from 2019
4. Pick "cooking class" because it sounds safe
5. She's already done 3 cooking classes this year

Planning a date with Vela:
1. Open app
2. Pick the highest-scored idea
3. She loves it
```

**Template 16: The "I Built This Because" Thread**
```
I built Vela because of one embarrassing moment.

I planned a "surprise" date to an escape room.

My partner hates escape rooms.

She didn't say anything. But I could tell.

That's when I realized: I didn't actually know what kind of dates she loved.

So I built an app that figures it out for you.

🧵
```

**Template 17: The Feature Spotlight**
```
My favorite Vela feature that nobody talks about:

The scoring system.

Every date idea gets a compatibility score based on your partner's quiz answers.

95+ = she'll love it
80-94 = solid choice
Below 80 = maybe not this time

No more guessing.
```

**Template 18: The Retweet Bait**
```
RT if you've ever Googled "date ideas" in a panic 30 minutes before you needed to leave.

(I built an app so you never have to do that again.)
```

**Template 19: The Partner Perspective**
```
What she's thinking when you say "I planned something for us tonight":

Option A: "Oh no, not the same restaurant again"
Option B: "Please not another movie"
Option C: "Wait... this is actually amazing. How did you know?"

Vela makes Option C happen.
```

**Template 20: The Vulnerability Post**
```
Honest founder moment:

I launched Vela [X] weeks ago and some days I wonder if anyone cares about what I'm building.

Then I get a DM like this:

[Screenshot]

Back to work.
```

## 7. Examples of Successful Indie App Launch Strategies

### Case Study 1: Marc Lou (ShipFast, LogoFast)
- **Strategy:** Built audience to 45K+ followers before launching by building in public daily
- **Launch tweet format:** Direct, clear value proposition ("Make beautiful logos with AI, fast and free")
- **Tactic:** Offered "$50 off for the first 50 customers" to create urgency
- **Result:** Single announcement tweet reached 167,000 impressions

**Lesson for Vela:** Build the audience NOW. Every build-in-public tweet before launch day is compounding interest.

### Case Study 2: Tibo Louis-Lucas (Revid.ai)
- **Strategy:** Acquired an underperforming product, noticed unexpected user behavior, pivoted and documented the journey
- **Result:** Grew from under $1K/month to $10K MRR
- **Approach:** Transparent storytelling about the pivot

**Lesson for Vela:** Document unexpected findings from user behavior. "I built Vela for X, but users are using it for Y" is a powerful narrative.

### Case Study 3: Rob Hallam (SuperX)
- **Strategy:** Built in stealth for 6 months, then launched publicly
- **Result:** $38,000 in 4 months, grew to 18,000 followers
- **Approach:** Combined stealth building with explosive public launch

**Lesson for Vela:** If you haven't been building in public, frame it as a reveal. "I've been secretly building something for 6 months" is a powerful hook.

### Case Study 4: Pieter Levels (NomadList, PhotoAI)
- **Strategy:** 10 years of consistent building in public, launching 40+ products
- **Result:** PhotoAI hit $5.4K first week, $132K MRR by month 18
- **Audience:** 600K+ Twitter followers
- **Approach:** Radical transparency, sharing revenue, daily posting

**Lesson for Vela:** This is a long game. Every tweet is an investment in future launches.

### Common Patterns Across All Successful Launches:
1. Clear, specific value proposition in the first line
2. Building in public before launch day
3. Personal story connected to the product
4. Real metrics shared transparently
5. Community engagement (replying to every comment)
6. Cross-platform coordination (Twitter + Product Hunt + Reddit)
7. Launch-day urgency (limited offers, countdowns)

---

## 8. What NOT to Do

### Mistake 1: Launching Without an Audience
Launching to zero followers is like opening a restaurant in an empty building. Spend at least 2-4 weeks building an audience before launch day. Even 200-500 engaged followers is better than launching cold.

### Mistake 2: Making Launch Day a Single Tweet
Launching is not a single post -- it's a relentless, ongoing process of outreach, storytelling, and insertion into existing conversations. Plan for 5-10 tweets on launch day, plus engagement in replies.

### Mistake 3: Only Posting Breadcrumb Updates
"Working on a feature today" over and over will cause your audience to tune out. Mix short updates with longer-form threads, insights, and value-adding content.

### Mistake 4: Being Too Promotional
The 80/20 rule: 80% valuable/entertaining content, 20% self-promotion. If every tweet is "download Vela," people will unfollow. Give value first.

### Mistake 5: Generic Engagement
Leaving comments like "Great post!" or "Love this!" on other people's tweets is worthless. Read tweets carefully, contribute thoughtful responses, ask real questions.

### Mistake 6: Engaging with Trolls
Ignore provocateurs. Responding to trolls wastes energy and can spiral. Your time is better spent engaging with genuine potential users.

### Mistake 7: Hashtag Stuffing in Bio
Your bio should give people a reason to follow you, not a list of hashtags. Example of a good bio: "Solo founder building Vela -- a date night app that knows what your partner wants. Shipping daily."

### Mistake 8: Ignoring Timing
Tweeting at 11 PM on a Saturday reaches almost nobody. Post during peak hours (9 AM - 12 PM, and 5 PM - 7 PM in your target timezone, Tuesday-Thursday for launches).

### Mistake 9: No Visual Content
Text-only tweets get significantly less engagement. Tweets with images get 150% more retweets. Always include screenshots, mockups, GIFs, or videos when possible.

### Mistake 10: Disappearing After Launch
65% of products lose momentum within 90 days. The post-launch content engine is just as important as launch day. Plan your content calendar for at least 8 weeks post-launch.

### Mistake 11: Selling to Other Indie Hackers Instead of Your Actual Users
The indie hacker community on Twitter is supportive but they are not your customers. Your customers are guys in relationships aged 22-35. Make sure your content speaks to THEM, not to other founders. Build-in-public content is great for reach, but dating content is what converts your actual users.

### Mistake 12: Not Replying to Comments
Reply to every single comment on your tweets, especially in the first few weeks. The algorithm rewards engagement, and it builds genuine community.

---

## 9. Cross-Platform Launch Coordination

Research shows the most successful indie launches coordinate across multiple platforms simultaneously. Here is the recommended launch day sequence:

### Launch Day Timeline

**12:01 AM:** Product Hunt listing goes live (if using Product Hunt; consider launching on a weekend when competition is lower -- top spot requires ~366 upvotes on Saturday vs. ~633 on Monday)

**9:00 AM:** Primary launch tweet goes live on Twitter/X

**9:30 AM:** Post on relevant subreddits (r/dating_advice, r/AskMen, r/relationships, r/sideproject, r/indiehackers)

**10:00 AM:** LinkedIn post (more professional angle: solo founder story)

**11:00 AM:** Launch thread on Twitter (the 7-tweet story thread)

**1:00 PM:** Instagram/TikTok content (short video demo)

**2:00 PM:** Mid-day Twitter update with real-time metrics

**5:00 PM:** Email to any existing waitlist/newsletter subscribers

**7:00 PM:** Evening Twitter reflection post

**All day:** Reply to every comment, DM, and mention across all platforms. Link back to Product Hunt in Twitter replies when relevant ("Thanks! If you like it, would love your support on Product Hunt: [link]").

---

## 10. Metrics to Track

### Twitter-Specific Metrics
- **Impressions per tweet** (aim for consistent growth week over week)
- **Engagement rate** (likes + retweets + replies / impressions; aim for 2-5%)
- **Profile visits** (leading indicator of curiosity)
- **Follower growth rate** (track daily during launch week)
- **Link clicks** (the metric that actually matters for downloads)
- **Top-performing tweet formats** (identify what resonates and double down)

### Launch Metrics
- **Day 1 downloads/signups**
- **Quiz completion rate** (are users finishing the quiz?)
- **Return rate** (do users come back?)
- **Which tweets drove the most link clicks** (UTM tag your links)

---
